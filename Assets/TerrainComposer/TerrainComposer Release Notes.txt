TerrainComposer final version 1.04
----------------------------------
Included "procedural landscape1" finished project from video.

Updates:
- TerrainComposer latest downloaded version will be in the folder -> TerrainComposer -> Update. You can use
  this package if you start a new project.

Features:

- Seperate colormap and splat texture slots. The colormap textures are loaded automatically, you only need to set them.
- Can apply a colormap in standard shader in splat slot 0.
- image/heightmap import into filters/subfilers by naming string (alt click search button).
- Edge blur in filter with radius for images with splat texturing.To get smooth edges. 
- Added color range select mode. Now you can select colors/splats/trees/grass/objects directly with using images in
  filters and subfilters.
- Auto detect colors from an image in filters/subfilters.
- Curve swapping in filters/subfilters.
- Perlin curve offset range modifier to fine tune offset. Reset button to set offset to zero. Randomize button for
  random offset.
- Terrain Settings can be copied with creating new terrains. So you don't need to click set all buttons for 
  splat/trees/grass.
- Run in background option -> TC Menu -> Generate Settings -> Run in Background.
- Automatic Autofit terrains in TC Menu -> Generate Settings -> Auto Fit Terrains.


Presets:
- Preset for heightmap creation with perlin curve and filter settings with new heightmap layers. Only works with 
  setting popup field at the left of '>view' button to "heightmap", and then add a layer.


Improvements:
- Perlin zooms into the middle.
- Smoothing is more sensitive, can smooth with decimals
- Tree and Object resolutions in Local Area.

GUI Interface:
- Instead of standard Filter/Subfilter text. Now the text can be displayed what each filter/subfilter is doing with
  each layer output. You can enable/disable this in TC Menu -> View -> Filter Select Text.
- Detail per patch slider.
- Can setup terrain (splat/tree/grass) before creating.
- Can shift click small red fit all button next to terrain to fit all.
- Blue tool button enable/disable. Disable will close the image tools window.

Fixes:
- Measure tool, measures grass correcly.
- Pattern tool empty patterns generate error.
